##  Key Features
1. **Multi-Platform Collection**: Gathers data from three distinct sources: YouTube, GitHub, and the n8n Community Forum.

2. **Cross-Platform De-duplication**: Ensures that every workflow in the final dataset is unique by using the source link as an identifier, even if it's popular on multiple platforms.

3. **Weighted Popularity Score**: Ranks all workflows using a robust scoring system that considers views, stars, and engagement ratios for fair cross-platform comparison.

4. **Country-Specific Search**: Performs targeted searches on YouTube for both the US and India to fulfill country segmentation requirements.

5. **Automated Data Pipeline**: The main.py script is a cron-ready job that automates the entire data collection, cleaning, and scoring process.

6. **REST API with Frontend**: Serves the final ranked data via a FastAPI endpoint and includes an interactive index.html dashboard to view and refresh the data on demand.
